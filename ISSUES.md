# Architectural Issues Report

## Overview
This document outlines critical architectural problems identified in the Delula codebase that require immediate attention and refactoring.

## 🚨 Critical Issues

### 1. Database Schema Problems

**Severity: HIGH**

**Problems:**
- Overly complex schema with too many fields per table (recipes table has 20+ fields)
- Mixed concerns in single tables (recipes contain both content and configuration)

- No database migrations visible in the codebase
- No proper foreign key constraints in some cases

**Files affected:**
- `shared/schema.ts`
- `server/storage.ts`
- `server/db.ts`

### 2. Service Architecture Issues

**Severity: HIGH**

**Problems:**
- Monolithic structure - everything in one Express app
- No service layer abstraction - business logic mixed with HTTP handlers
- Direct database access from route handlers instead of proper service classes
- No dependency injection or proper separation of concerns
- Circular dependencies likely present

**Files affected:**
- `server/routes.ts` (1588 lines of mixed concerns)
- `server/index.ts`
- `server/storage.ts`

### 3. Queue System Problems

**Severity: HIGH**

**Problems:**

### 7. Error Handling Issues

**Severity: MEDIUM**

**Problems:**
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- No centralized error logging or monitoring
- Generic error messages that don't help debugging
- No proper error recovery strategies
- Errors sometimes thrown without proper context

**Files affected:**
- `server/error-handler.ts`
- Most route handlers
- Service files

### 8. Testing Infrastructure

**Severity: HIGH**

**Problems:**
- No visible test files in the codebase
- No testing framework setup
- No CI/CD pipeline visible
- No code quality tools (linting, formatting)
- No integration tests for critical flows

**Missing:**
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- E2E tests
- Test utilities
- CI/CD configuration

### 9. Security Vulnerabilities

**Severity: CRITICAL**

**Problems:**
- Session secrets with fallback to hardcoded values
- No input validation on many endpoints
- SQL injection risks despite using ORM
- No CSRF protection visible
- Insecure file uploads without proper validation
- No rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- Missing security headers

**Files affected:**
- `server/index.ts` (session configuration)
- Route handlers with file uploads
- Authentication endpoints

### 10. Performance Issues

**Severity: MEDIUM**

**Problems:**
- No caching strategy implemented
- Database queries not optimized
- No connection pooling configuration visible
- Synchronous operations in async contexts
- No pagination on large result sets

**Files affected:**
- `server/storage.ts`
- `server/db.ts`
- Route handlers

### 11. Code Organization Problems

**Severity: MEDIUM**

**Problems:**
- Mixed file types in same directories
- No clear module boundaries
- Circular dependencies likely present
- No proper TypeScript usage patterns
- Inconsistent file naming conventions

**Affected directories:**
- `server/` (mixed concerns)
- `client/src/` (poor organization)
- `shared/` (minimal shared code)

### 12. Deployment Issues

**Severity: MEDIUM**

**Problems:**
- Single server deployment with no load balancing
- No health checks or monitoring
- No proper logging infrastructure
- No backup strategies visible
- No environment-specific configurations

**Files affected:**
