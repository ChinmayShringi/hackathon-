# Backlog Cleanup System

## Overview

The Backlog Cleanup System is a critical maintenance component that prevents the accumulation of failed generations in the `system_backlog` user account during service interruptions. Without this system, a service outage could flood the backlog account with thousands of failed generations, wasting resources and potentially causing performance issues.

## üö® Why This System is Critical

### The Problem
During service interruptions (e.g., FAL.ai API downtime, network issues, or system failures), the backlog maintenance service continues to attempt generating content. Each failed attempt creates a generation record with `status = 'failed'`. Without cleanup:

- **Resource Waste**: Failed generations consume database space and memory
- **Performance Degradation**: Queries become slower with large numbers of failed records
- **System Instability**: Excessive failed generations can impact the entire backlog system
- **Debugging Difficulty**: Too many failed records make it hard to identify real issues

### The Solution
The Backlog Cleanup System automatically removes failed generations while preserving recent ones for debugging purposes:

- **Daily Cleanup**: Automatically runs every day at 2:00 AM UTC
- **Smart Retention**: Keeps up to 10 recent failed generations per recipe for debugging
- **Age-Based Cleanup**: Removes failed generations older than 24 hours
- **Emergency Cleanup**: Manual option to remove ALL failed generations when needed

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **BacklogCleanupService** (`server/service-backlog-cleanup.ts`)
   - Main cleanup logic and orchestration
   - Age-based cleanup with smart retention
   - Emergency cleanup capabilities

2. **PostgreSQL Function** (`backlog_cleanup_failed_generations()`)
   - Database-level cleanup function
   - Runs via pg_cron for automated daily execution
   - Efficient bulk deletion with proper indexing

3. **Admin API Endpoints** (`/api/admin/backlog-cleanup/*`)
   - Status monitoring
   - Manual cleanup execution
   - Emergency cleanup operations

4. **CLI Scripts** (`scripts/run-backlog-cleanup.ts`)
   - Command-line interface for manual operations
   - Status checking and monitoring
   - Emergency cleanup execution

### Cleanup Strategy

```typescript
interface CleanupConfig {
  CLEANUP_AGE_HOURS: 24;                    // Remove failed generations older than 24h
  MAX_FAILED_GENERATIONS_PER_RECIPE: 10;    // Keep up to 10 recent failed per recipe
  CLEANUP_SCHEDULE: '0 2 * * *';           // Daily at 2:00 AM UTC
}
```

#### Regular Cleanup Process
1. **Age Filtering**: Only consider failed generations older than 24 hours
2. **Recipe Grouping**: Group failed generations by recipe ID
3. **Smart Retention**: For each recipe, keep the 10 most recent failed generations
4. **Bulk Deletion**: Remove oldest failed generations in efficient batches
5. **Audit Logging**: Record cleanup operations in credit_transactions table

#### Emergency Cleanup Process
1. **Immediate Action**: Remove ALL failed generations regardless of age
2. **Complete Reset**: Clean slate for the backlog system
3. **Use with Caution**: Only when there's critical accumulation

## üöÄ Usage

### Automated Daily Cleanup

The system automatically runs daily cleanup via PostgreSQL's `pg_cron` extension:

```bash
# Set up the daily cron job (one-time setup)
npm run backlog-cleanup-setup
```

This creates:
- A PostgreSQL function: `backlog_cleanup_failed_generations()`
- A cron job: `backlog-cleanup-daily` running at 2:00 AM UTC daily

### Manual Operations

#### Check Current Status
```bash
# View backlog status including failed generation counts
npm run backlog-cleanup status

# Or directly with tsx
npx tsx scripts/run-backlog-cleanup.ts status
```

#### Run Manual Cleanup
```bash
# Run regular cleanup (removes old failed generations)
npm run backlog-cleanup cleanup

# Or directly with tsx
npx tsx scripts/run-backlog-cleanup.ts cleanup
```

#### Emergency Cleanup
```bash
# Remove ALL failed generations (use with caution)
npm run backlog-cleanup emergency

# Or directly with tsx
npx tsx scripts/run-backlog-cleanup.ts emergency
```

### Admin API Operations

## üìä Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics

#### Cleanup Performance
- **Total Failed Generations**: Count of all failed generations in backlog
- **Cleanup Rate**: Percentage of failed generations removed per cleanup cycle
- **Recipes Affected**: Number of recipes with failed generations
- **Cleanup Frequency**: How often cleanup runs and its success rate

#### System Health
- **Failed Generation Accumulation**: Rate of failed generation creation
- **Cleanup Effectiveness**: Whether cleanup is keeping pace with failures
- **Recipe-Specific Issues**: Which recipes are generating the most failures

### Monitoring Queries

#### Check Failed Generation Counts
```sql
-- Overall failed generation count
SELECT COUNT(*) as failed_count
FROM generations 
WHERE user_id = 'system_backlog' 
  AND status = 'failed';

-- Failed generations by recipe
SELECT 
  r.name as recipe_name,
  COUNT(g.id) as failed_count,
  MAX(g.updated_at) as latest_failure
FROM generations g
JOIN recipes r ON g.recipe_id = r.id
WHERE g.user_id = 'system_backlog' 
  AND g.status = 'failed'
GROUP BY r.id, r.name
ORDER BY failed_count DESC;
```

#### Monitor Cleanup Operations
```sql
-- Recent cleanup operations
SELECT 
  user_id,
  amount as generations_removed,
  description,
  created_at
FROM credit_transactions 
WHERE type = 'backlog_cleanup'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Check Cron Job Status
```sql
-- Verify cleanup cron job is active
SELECT 
  jobid,
  jobname,
  schedule,
  command,
  active
FROM cron.job 
WHERE jobname = 'backlog-cleanup-daily';
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

No additional environment variables are required beyond the standard database configuration.

### Database Requirements

#### Required Extensions
```sql
-- pg_cron extension for scheduled jobs
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS cron;
```

**Note**: pg_cron requires superuser privileges to install.

#### Required Tables
- `generations` - Contains the generation records to clean up
- `users` - Contains the system_backlog user account
- `credit_transactions` - For audit logging of cleanup operations

### Cleanup Parameters

#### Adjustable Constants
```typescript
const CLEANUP_AGE_HOURS = 24;                    // Age threshold for cleanup
const MAX_FAILED_GENERATIONS_PER_RECIPE = 10;    // Retention limit per recipe
const CLEANUP_SCHEDULE = '0 2 * * *';           // Cron schedule (daily at 2 AM UTC)
```

#### Customization
To modify cleanup parameters:

1. **Update the service**: Modify constants in `service-backlog-cleanup.ts`
2. **Update the function**: Modify the PostgreSQL function via the setup script
3. **Update the cron schedule**: Modify the schedule in the setup script

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Cleanup Not Running
**Symptoms**: Failed generations accumulating, no cleanup logs
**Diagnosis**: Check if pg_cron extension is installed and cron job is active
**Solution**: Run `npm run backlog-cleanup-setup` to verify setup

#### Insufficient Permissions
**Symptoms**: "pg_cron extension not found" error
**Diagnosis**: Database user lacks superuser privileges
**Solution**: Contact database administrator to install pg_cron extension

#### Cleanup Function Errors
**Symptoms**: Cleanup operations failing with database errors
**Diagnosis**: Check database logs for function execution errors
**Solution**: Verify the cleanup function exists and has proper permissions

### Debug Commands

#### Check System Status
```bash
# Verify all components are working
npm run backlog-cleanup status

# Check if cron job is active
npx tsx scripts/run-backlog-cleanup.ts status
```

#### Test Cleanup Function
```sql
-- Test the cleanup function directly
SELECT backlog_cleanup_failed_generations();

-- Check for any errors in the logs
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE query LIKE '%backlog_cleanup%';
```

#### Verify Cron Job
```sql
-- Check cron job status
SELECT * FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'backlog-cleanup-daily';

-- Check recent job runs
SELECT * FROM cron.job_run_details 
WHERE jobid = (SELECT jobid FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'backlog-cleanup-daily')
ORDER BY start_time DESC LIMIT 5;
```
