## Available Scripts

### `create-pr.ts`

Creates a pull request from the `main` branch to the `test-aws-deployment` branch with an interactive prompt-based interface.

#### Features

- **Interactive Prompts**: User-friendly CLI interface with prompts for:
  - Reason (default: "New build from `main` branch")
  - Issue number (optional)
  - Mode selection (Debugging/Production) with arrow key navigation
- **Automatic Commit Summary**: Compares branches and includes new commits in the PR description
- **GitHub Integration**: Uses GitHub API to create PRs on behalf of the authenticated user
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with fallback logic
- **Validation**: Validates git state and branch existence before creating PR

#### Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Token**: Set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable with a valid GitHub personal access token
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
   ```
   
   Or add it to your `.env` file:
   ```
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
   ```

2. **Git Setup**: Ensure you're in a git repository with:
   - `main` branch exists
   - `test-aws-deployment` branch exists
   - Proper remote origin configured

#### Usage

```bash
# Using npm script (recommended)
npm run create-pr

# List active jobs with custom limit
npm run queue-manager active 20

# List all jobs
npm run queue-manager all

# List failed jobs
npm run queue-manager failed

- **Error Handling**: Handles network issues, completed jobs, and invalid job IDs
- **Result Preview**: Shows available results for completed jobs

## Development

All scripts are written in TypeScript and use `tsx` for execution. They follow the project's coding standards and include proper error handling.

## Dependencies

The scripts use the following key dependencies:

- `@octokit/rest`: GitHub API integration
- `inquirer`: Interactive CLI prompts
- `chalk`: Colored console output
- `tsx`: TypeScript execution
